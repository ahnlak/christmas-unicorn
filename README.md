The Christmas Unicorn
=====================

Such a wonderful device deserves some festive love.

An evolving Christmas card, featuring:

* falling snow
* growing trees
* _festive tunes_
* _sleighs_
* _raindeer_
* _presents_

(items in _italic_ are still works in progress)

Usage
-----

Simply copy all the `.py` files onto your Unicorn (via `thonny`, `ampy` or
whichever technology you prefer) and reset it to launch.

Brightness and volume can be adjusted with the buttons on the right of your
Unicorn.

Music can be turned on and off with the A button.

Note
----

This is rapidly becoming the biggest single thing I've crafted in (micro)Python,
so please forgive the Luddite manner in which I write Python code :-)
